                IMPORTING THE MODULES
STEP 1: The program  starts by importing the necessary modules, "Key"and "Listener" from the "pynput.keyboard" module.

                                      
STEP 2: Then create  ("keys[]" )list is initialized as an empty list.       This list will be used to store the pressed keys.
                DECLARING THE FUNCTIONS	

STEP 3:The("on_press") function is defined. This function is called when a key is pressed. It takes the pressed key as an argument and appends it to the ("keys[]") list.

STEP 4: The ("on_release") function is defined. This function is called when a key is released.
It takes the released key as an argument. In this function, the   script opens the "log.txt" file in write mode ('w'),
and then writes the content of the keys list to the file using the "writelines method". 
The keys list is converted to a STRING before writing it to the file.


STEP 5:The ("with")statement is used to create a LISTENER object. 
The Listener object is responsible for monitoring the keyboard events and calling the appropriate callback functions        
(on_press and on_release) when a key is pressed or released.


STEP 6 :In side the "with" statement, the ("listener.join()") method is called.This method starts the listener and waits for it to finish.
It essentially blocks the program's execution and keeps it running until the listener is stopped or interrupted.
